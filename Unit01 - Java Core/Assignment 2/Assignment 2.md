### Assignment 2
How oop principles perform in java?
```
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java are implemented through classes and objects. The main principles of OOP in Java are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. OOP principles in Java enable developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems by organizing code into classes and objects that interact with each other.
```
#
### Encapsulation
Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed through public methods. This helps to protect the object's internal state from external interference and misuse.  

#
### Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another. This enables code reuse and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

#
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. This allows for more flexibility in programming and enables methods to be overridden or overloaded.

#
### Abstraction
Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the outside world. This helps to simplify complex systems and improve modularity.
